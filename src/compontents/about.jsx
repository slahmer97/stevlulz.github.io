                        <p>Iâ€™m a roboticist, cell biologist (PhD), and mathematician (BA) studying the movement and
                            control of complex systems. At the cellular level, I studied the mechanisms that control
                            cell-shape changes in embryonic cells. As a roboticist, I am applying reinforcement learning
                            to grasping. My long-term research objective is to combine tools from machine learning,
                            optimization, and control theory to design algorithms for robotic locomotion and
                            manipulation in real-world settings.</p>
